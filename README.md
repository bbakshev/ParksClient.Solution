2. Open the terminal and navigate to this project's production directory called "ParksClient".
3. Within the production directory "ParksClient", run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
4. Open the browser to _https://localhost:7153/_. If you cannot access https://localhost:5096 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS.
